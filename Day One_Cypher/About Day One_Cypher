This is the first project of The_Twelve_Days_Of_Random_Applications_That_Have_No_Use. It is a cypher. The same seed will always generate the same cypher, so if you need
to decypher anything after you have changed the cypher, just change the seed to the one you used to cypher it, and type it in (Make sure to use a backslash \ as the first
character to tell the program that you want it to decypher).
